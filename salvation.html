        <h2>Following Jesus Christ</h2>
        <p>Being a Christian means truly following Christ‚Äîembracing His teachings, values, and mission.
             As His followers, we are called to walk in His footsteps and uphold what He stood for. God's desire is to continue His work through us,
             just as Jesus commissioned in Matthew 28:18-20.</p>
            <i>"18 Then Jesus came to them and said, ‚ÄúAll authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. 
            19 Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
                20 and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you.
                 And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.‚Äù</i>

        <h2>Why Jesus Christ Came?</h2>
        <h4> Redemption</h4>
        <p><b>Jesus Christ came to become the lamb that would take away the sins of men.</b></p>
        <p>All throughout the Old Testament, God revealed His plan of redemption. 
            In those times, people atoned for their sins by offering a spotless lamb as a sacrifice.
             Since the consequence of sin is death, the only way for a sinner to be pardoned was for an innocent and blameless substitute to take their place, paying the price through death‚Äîthis is the concept of atonement.

            </p>
            <span class="read-more">
            In the New Testament, Jesus  became the ultimate, 
            blameless Lamb‚Äîthe sacrifice God Himself provided for humanity. His atonement is available to all 
            who believe in His name and the finished 
            work of the cross (1 Peter 1:19-20, Revelation 13:8).
        <p>
        </p>
    
        <h4> Spreading Good News</h4>
        <p>Jesus went from town to town preaching that the kingdom of God is at hand and people should repent.
            Thus He send His desciples to preach the gospel in His name (Matthew 28:18-20).
        </p>

        <h4>"..As the Father send Me , I am sending you.."</h4>
        
        <p>Jesus life and ministry were an example for us to follow.
            The father sent him to seek the lost and reconcile them to God.Jesus send us to do the same thing
            in His name, not our names. (1 Corinthians 14:33, John 3:16-18 ,John 20:21).
            We are supposed to live for the same purpose Jesus Christ lived for and one to do so,they
            ought to study,understand the life and purpose of Christ.

        <h2>The Re-creation (Becoming New Creation)</h2>
        <p>The Bible teaches that anyone who is in Christ becomes a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). This transformation has a purpose,
             as revealed in Ephesians 2:10‚Äîwe are created in Christ Jesus to live out the good works God has prepared for us. <br>
            <i>"For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, 
                which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them."</i>

        <h2>How Can I Be Born Again/Saved?</h2>
        <p>Salvation is a gift from God, available to everyone through faith in Jesus Christ.
             Here‚Äôs how you can receive Him: <br>
             <h4>Acknowledge Your Need for Salvation</h4>
            <i>Recognize that all have sinned and fallen short of God‚Äôs glory (Romans 3:23).
            Understand that sin separates us from God and leads to spiritual death (Romans 6:23).</i>
        </p>

        <h4>Believe in Jesus Christ</h4>
            <i>Trust that Jesus is the Son of God who came to save humanity (John 3:16).
            Believe that He died for your sins and rose again to give you eternal life (Romans 10:9).</i>

            <h4>Confess , repent and accept Jesus as Lord and Savior</h4>
            <i>Confess Jesus as Lord and turn away from sin (1 John 1:9).
                True repentance means a change of heart and mind, desiring to follow God‚Äôs ways.</i>
                
    </div>

    <div class="blog-post">
        <h2>Conclusion Prayer</h2>
        <p>We hope this message on salvation has blessed you. If you haven‚Äôt yet received Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, we invite you to do so today.

            my mouth that Jesus Christ is the Lord of my life from this day.Through Him and in His name 
        I have eternal life."</i> Amen.
